As one of the tasks in his masters' thesis, Ricardo developed a working [LT Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby_transform_code) \[1\] implementation. Afterwards, Ricardo became interested in fountain codes in general, and Raptor codes in specific.

Currently, Ricardo is helping maintain the project, adding new/better functionalities and improving the encoding and decoding performance.
