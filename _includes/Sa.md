For his masters' thesis, Jos&eacute; proposed studying the resilience of the RaptorQ code against malicious faults. Confronted with the inexistence of any free/open implementation of the standard, part of Jos&eacute;'s work was implementing [RFC 6330](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6330).

After completing his study on RaptorQ's resilience, Jos&eacute; thought it would be a shame to let all the time and effort put in implementing [RFC 6330](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6330) go to waste. Given the lack of open RaptorQ implementations, the obvious choice was to make it an open source project.
